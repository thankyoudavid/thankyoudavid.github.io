    Mr. Demarest,
    <br/></br>
    In the spirit of thanksgiving, I wanted to extend a long, long overdue thank you for the wonderful experience I had with Annie and your family this summer. My time in Canada was truly incredible, and I am so grateful that you put so much time and energy into making the trip a reality. I feel truly embarrassed that I didn't extend a thank you in a remotely timely matter, but I'm hoping the "better late than never" phrase applies here. Annie has been my family since 6th grade, supporting me and caring for me even as my own family has gone through ups and downs. The fact that you've included me in the Demarest summer adventures for the past two years means the world to me. My times in the middle of nowhere Wyoming and BC have been so, so memorable â€“ and they wouldn't have been possible without your generosity and kindness. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I owe Annie a trip around the world.
    <br/></br>
    Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
    <br/></br>
    Love,
    <br/></br>
    Lizzy
